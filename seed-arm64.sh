# GCP Cloud Build does not have builders with ARM chips, so building 'linux/arm64' images
# take a very long time (due to the QEMU emulation).  It takes over an hour which
# triggers this failure:
#
#   #32 ERROR: failed to authorize: failed to fetch oauth token: unexpected status: 401 Unauthorized
#
# We found a workaround (explained here: https://github.com/dougdonohoe/build-timeout), which allows
# builds to succeed, but they still take a while.
#
# The purpose of this script is to run a build on an M1 Mac (i.e., one with Apple Silicon) or arm64 Linux VM
#  and take advantage of Docker caching to cache the results.  A subsequent linux/arm64 build in GCP should
# utilize these cached results.  This script extracts and runs the same docker build steps specified in the
# cloudbuild/pr.yaml file (to avoid having to duplicate steps in that file here).
#
# The original intent is that a developer making changes to this repo should run this script from the local
# branch (after the PR is approved) but prior to PR merging.  By doing so, the cache is updated, and then when
# the PR is merged, which kicks off the cloud build, the ARM building steps should use the newly updated cache.
# In development, this eliminates the need to sometimes multiple hours for the build to complete.
#
# The subsequent intent is to use this from an arm64 VM, via cron, so the arm64 half of the build can be seeded
# before the 4am Sunday scheduled build.
#
# Usage: ENV=name seed-arm64.sh [--dry-run]
#    --dry-run: echos docker commands instead of running them so you can sanity check
#    ENV=name: define the environment (e.g., 'docker-prod' or 'docker-dev' ... in normal usage this is set via the Makefile)
#
